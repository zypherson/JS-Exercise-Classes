        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property gets set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person class whose constructor initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should also initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 3

    - Its constructor should initialize `name`, `age` and `location` properties on the instance.

    - Instructor instances have the following methods:
        + `demo` receives a `subject` string as an argument and returns the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
        + `grade` receives a `student` object and a `subject` string as arguments and returns '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'

        + `PRAssignment` a method that receives a subject as an argument and returns `student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}`

        + `debugsCode` a method that takes in a student object and a subject and returns `{name} debugs {student.name}'s code on {subject}`

/*
  STRETCH PROBLEM (no tests!)
    - Extend the functionality of the Student by adding a prop called grade and setting it equal to a number between 1-100.
    - Now that our students have a grade build out a method on the Instructor (this will be used by _BOTH_ instructors and PM's) that will randomly add or subtract points to a student's grade. _Math.random_ will help.
    - Add a graduate method to a student.
      + This method, when called, will check the grade of the student and see if they're ready to graduate from BloomTech
      + If the student's grade is above a 70% let them graduate! Otherwise go back to grading their assignments to increase their score.
